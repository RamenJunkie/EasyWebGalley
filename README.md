# EasyWebGalley
A single file to create a simple gallery of images in a directory using PHP.

Use:

Drop the index.php file into a directory on your web server with images, then when accessed it will create a basic responsive gallery of those images.  

If needed the index.php can be renammed.

This loads the images straight, with no thumbnails or anything, so large images will load slowly.  This can be fixed by resizing and optimizing your image sizes.

The intent is to simply have an extremely simple way to create simple galleries for sharing images in a single esy to use file.  Feel free to monify or improve upon this.
